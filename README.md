# weather_display
Code that gathers weather data from openweathermap.org then turns a servo motor to point at the
current conditions and lights an LED on a physical display. This is my first time working with a
servo motor. You may need to adjust the angles in the code to improve the accuracy for the 
servo you are using. Or not.

You will need a valid API key from open weather map. https://openweathermap.org/

Info on setting up the angular servo found here: https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

To install PYOWM: https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm

I included pictures of the finished front and back (before tidying the wires inside) as well as
the housing. The front is a 25cm x 20cm canvas painted with acrylic. The servo, 3mm LEDs, etc. are
all standard issue. 

Cheers!
