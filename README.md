# weather_display
Code that gathers weather data from openweathermap.org then turns a servo motor to point at the
current conditions and lights an LED on a physical display. You will need a valid API keep from
open weather map. 

Info on setting up the angular servo found here: https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
